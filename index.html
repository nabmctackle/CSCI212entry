            <p>What goes in a paragraph about myself? Im honestly not really sure what to say. I'm a pretty big nerd. I love gaming and dnd as hobbies. 
                I'm trying to make some changes in the direction of my life after covid. </p>

            <p>I graduated from a web dev bootcamp back in 2018.
                I was misled about the help that I would recieve in translating my skills into a jobset. I feel like I have a decent programming knowledge, but I never set myself up for success my properly displaying that. 
                My biggest regret is that I kept leaving unfinished projects, and took a non-coding job after the bootcamp. I let my skills decay.</p>

                <h2>Things I hope to improve on in this course</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am hoping to focus on node because it is my favorite </li>
                    <li>I am hoping that I can upload projects to github because my skills in that area are lacking.</li>
                    <li>I am hoping to learn some front end interfaces other than angular 2</li>
                    <li>I am hoping to improve on my ability to create websites that look pleasing, compared to looking like craigslist. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Things I expect from a teacher</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I expect you to be completely comfortable with the course material. My previous quarter java professor confidently proclaimed that 9%4 was 2, as well "you dont have to know what your code does as long as it runs", which caused me to lose faith in him</li>
                    <li>I expect you to be fair.</li>
                    <li>I expect all requirements to be adequately stated. Rubrics that accuretely convey requirements are everyone's best friend. For example, I didnt see any requirements on the quality of the CSS, nor did I see a requirement for the form to interact with the server page. I hope that what I have given is acceptable as technically it meets requirements </li>
                </ul>
